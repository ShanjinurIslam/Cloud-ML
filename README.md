# Cloud-ML

Sometimes your app may need some custom machine learning predictions but in mobile model prediction may be not the best way to do so!
That's why I made this backend with flutter App. I have already made the database, trained two models with two different datasets although it can support any ml model!
The app sends POST request to Django server and django server predicts results based on the provided model name and data and sends response back to the app.
This project scale is huge, I haven't yet started the Deep Learning Models part! But I am pretty happy with current result! And proud that I made it from scratch.
